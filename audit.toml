[advisories]
# Ignore unmaintained fxhash warning from scraper's dependency (selectors)
# This is a transitive dependency that we cannot control until scraper updates
# Tracking issue: https://github.com/causal-agent/scraper/issues/200
ignore = [
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0057",  # fxhash unmaintained - via scraper → selectors → fxhash
]

# Explanation:
# - scraper 0.24.0 (latest) depends on selectors 0.31.0
# - selectors 0.31.0 uses fxhash 0.2.1 (unmaintained)
# - This is a low-risk advisory (performance hash, not security)
# - Will be resolved when scraper/selectors updates their dependencies
# - Alternative: Replace scraper with different HTML parser (high effort)
