# Ignore unmaintained fxhash warning from transitive dependency
ignore = [
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0057",  # fxhash unmaintained - via scraper → selectors → fxhash
]

# Justification for ignoring RUSTSEC-2025-0057:
#
# 1. **Transitive dependency**: We don't use fxhash directly
#    - scraper 0.24.0 (latest as of 2025-11) → selectors 0.31.0 → fxhash 0.2.1
#
# 2. **Low security risk**: fxhash is a non-cryptographic hash function
#    - Used only for performance optimization in CSS selector matching
#    - The "unmaintained" advisory is about code maintenance, not security
#    - No known vulnerabilities, just lack of active development
#
# 3. **No control**: Cannot be fixed without upstream changes
#    - scraper maintainers would need to update selectors dependency
#    - selectors maintainers would need to replace fxhash
#    - Both projects are actively maintained, but haven't prioritized this
#
# 4. **Alternatives evaluated**:
#    - Replace scraper: High effort, scraper is best-in-class Rust HTML parser
#    - Use different selector engine: Would require forking scraper
#    - Wait for upstream: Most practical approach
#
# This ignore will be removed when:
# - scraper/selectors updates to maintained hash library (e.g., rustc-hash)
# - Alternative HTML parser with CSS selectors becomes available
